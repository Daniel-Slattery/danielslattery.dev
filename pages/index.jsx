          Greetings from London! I am an enterprising Front-End Developer
          working with a premier UK retail brand, where I bring complex digital
          experiences to life. My professional journey is quite unique; it began
          in the intricate world of biomedical engineering. This initial career
          honed my analytical skills and introduced me to the transformative
          power of technology in solving real-world problems. It wasn't long
          before my fascination with automating trading strategies led me down
          the path of codingâ€”a path that revealed my passion for the dynamic
          React and Next.js ecosystems. Today, I combine my background in
          engineering with a deep expertise in web development to deliver
          innovative, user-centered solutions. My mission is to create seamless,
          intuitive, and scalable web applications that enhance user interaction
          and engagement, whilst continuously exploring the frontiers of digital
          innovation.
