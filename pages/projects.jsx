        <p className="mt-2">
          You've stumbled upon a little corner of my site that's still a bit of
          a creative mess. I'm in the middle of adding some cool new stuff here,
          so things might look a bit wonky for now.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          In the meantime, feel free to roam around the rest of my site –
          there's plenty more to see! 🌟
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Stay tuned for some awesome updates coming your way. And hey, if
          you've got ideas or just want to say hi, drop me a line at
          daniel.slattery1@gmail.com. I'd love to hear from you!
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 mb-2">Catch you later! 🚀</p>
